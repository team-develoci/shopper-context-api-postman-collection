# Salesforce Shopper Context API

Welcome to the Develoci Shopper Context API Collection for Saleforce B2C Commerce! This collection contains a series of pre-configured API requests for testing and development purposes to help you to implement Shopper Context API. You can use this collection to test and later update into your e-commerce project as you need.


## Getting Started

To get started with the Postman Collection, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. [Download and install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) if you haven't already.
2. [Import the Shopper Context API Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data) into your Postman app.
3. Set the required environment variables for the requests.


### Setting Environment Variables

The Develoci Postman Collection requires the following environment variables to be set in order to use the pre-configured API requests:
